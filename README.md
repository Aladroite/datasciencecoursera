The goal of this project was to obtain and clean data for processing. 

### Orignial Data
The original data is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0, that was published by Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory. 

### Files
There are 3 files in this repo:

1. This README.md file

2. The run_analysis.R file that contains the scripts that were used to obtain and process that data

3. The codebook.md file that describes the data, variables, and processing steps. 

### Tidy Data Subset
The tidy data subset that was created as a result of the data processing is not included in this repo, but was uploaded as requested to the Coursera website.
